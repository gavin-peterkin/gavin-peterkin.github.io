# Additional Audio Samples

Below are samples from many different long short term memory (LSTM) recurrent
neural network (RNN) models. Please visit the [github repo](https://github.com/gavin-peterkin/music_composition)
for this project for more information about how these samples were generated.

# Longer samples

Here's a youtube video of a longer 30 second sample from the Corrette network.

The video below demonstrates the problem of overfitting that I initially encountered.

## Audio

**Warning: Some samples may sound horrible! Keep your hand close to the volume.**

**_Audio has only been tested to work in Chrome._**
# Sample of an untrained network
<audio controls preload>
  <source type="audio/ogg" src="/audio/sample_1.ogg"/>
  <p>Your browser does not support the audio element.</p>
</audio>
In this network, all of the feature weights are gaussian normal.

# A sample of what the network "hears" during training
This is parsed snippet from an organ composition by Thomas Arne.

# Images

Below are plots of predicted note probabilities as determined by the network on the
x-axis and time on the y-axis. The band on the right-hand side is a one-hot encoding
of the number of notes to play at that time, so density to the right indicates a louder
part while density to the left indicates silence.
