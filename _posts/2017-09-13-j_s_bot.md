# Survey

It would be very helpful for anyone viewing this to participate in
what should be an incredibly short survey.

_Audio has only been tested to work in Chrome._

## Instructions

Below are 10 audio samples each about 10 seconds long.
These samples were generated by a network in which some proportion
of the weights are random and the remaining proportion is from a network trained on
music. Your task is to listen to each and estimate to your best ability which proportion
of of the network is random. The remaining proportion is therefore trained.

For example, if you heard music that you recognize as from an actual composer,
you would say that it's 0% random. On the other hand, if you think you're listening to
random noise, you'd report 100%. Some samples may be totally random, some may be
actual music, and the rest are some combination. It's your task to estimate a
percent randomness for each sample.

Please record your responses as integers (50, 25, 33, etc.) indicating the
percent randomness separated by comma. You may send your responses via email
with the subject "survey" (link to my email below) or via slack.

### Sample response:
> 24,68,95,40,12,54,23,64,44,95
