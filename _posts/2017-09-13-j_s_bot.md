# Introduction

It has been a while since I've posted anything and that's because I've been working
and learning a ton about recurrent neural networks (RNNs) while working on my
data science capstone project at [Galvanize](https://www.galvanize.com).

I plan on including some music samples here along with more discussion once
I've had the chance to finish a survey. For now, here's a link to the [repo](https://github.com/gavin-peterkin/music_composition).
