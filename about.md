I'm a recent graduate of the data science immersive program at [Galvanize](https://www.galvanize.com/seattle/data-science#outcomes) seeking
full time data science opportunities in Seattle.
Prior to starting at Galvanize, I was an analyst at [ECONorthwest](http://www.econw.com),
an economic consulting firm, where I used tools in Python, SQL, and R to work on
a toll optimization model, time series analyses, county-wide housing inventory
analyses, economic impact analyses, and many more data-related and software
development tasks. I graduated in 2015 with a bachelors in Astronomy from Cornell.

#### I decided to create this blog for two reasons:
1. It forces me to record the things that I'm currently thinking or learning about,
so _I_ won't forget.
2. I've found blogs to be incredibly helpful for my own personal development and education,
so I'm hoping that someday someone will find something useful or interesting here.
