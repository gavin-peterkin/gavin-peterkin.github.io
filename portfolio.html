				Here is some of my work. Included, you'll find samples of my writing,
				 data analysis, lab reports, and more. Some of these projects were
				 completed as part of my curriculum while at Cornell. Some are projects
				 that I completed in my free time. Hopefully, some of them are even
				 interesting!
