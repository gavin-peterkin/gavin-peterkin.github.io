I'm data science student at [Galvanize](https://www.galvanize.com/seattle) in Seattle
graduating September 2017.
Prior to starting at Galvanize, I was an analyst at [ECONorthwest](http://www.econw.com),
an economic consulting firm, where I used tools in Python, SQL, and R to work on
a toll optimization model, time series analyses, county-wide housing inventory
analyses, economic impact analyses, and many more data-related and software
development tasks.

Before joining ECO, I was studying astronomy and physics as an undergrad
(both subjects I'm still very much interested in).

### I decided to create this blog for two reasons:
1. I've found blogs to be incredibly helpful for my own personal development and education,
so I'm hoping that someday someone will find something useful or interesting here.
2. It forces me to record the things that I'm currently thinking or learning about,
so _I_ won't forget.
